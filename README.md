# Mohs CMS Project
 
# Mohs.py is a script I wrote to determine the mean number of stages per Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) Procedure being performed by Medicare physicians.
# The CMS publically available dataset "Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners - by Provider and Service" was used to calculate the numbers of times certain CPT codes were billed, which was then used as a proxy for the number of stages performed per procedure.
